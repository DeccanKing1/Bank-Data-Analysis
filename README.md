I have carried out data abalysis to answer foloowing questions:

1. Which jobs types of customer are likely to subscribe term deposit?
2. Are Single or Married people more likely to subsrcibe term deposit?
3. Does education has any eddect on subscription of term deposit?

Installations: Python 3.6, pandas, matplotlib
